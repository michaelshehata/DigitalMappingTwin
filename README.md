🧭 Overview

This project aims to design and implement a Digital Twin capable of forecasting and visualising global land use changes over the next century. By integrating satellite imagery, GIS datasets, demographic trends, and environmental models, the system predicts patterns such as urban expansion, deforestation, and agricultural transformation.

The end result is an interactive web application that enables users to simulate “what-if” scenarios, exploring how policy decisions, population growth, or climate interventions may shape land use in the future.
